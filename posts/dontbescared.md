In February 2017, then Australian Treasurer Scott Morrison brought a lump of coal into parliament and said not to be scared.

The proposed Adani Coal mine in Queensland is predicted to produce 2.3 billion tonnes of coal, and this is what it would look like if Scott Morrison brought it to parliament. Burning that coal would produce approximately 6.6 Billion tonnes of C02.

Scott Morrison went on to become Australian Prime Minister in 2018.

Donâ€™t Be Scared will be featured as an augmented reality experience as part of the [2020 Contour 556 Art Festival](https://www.contour556.com.au/) in Canberra.
